# STEGGosaurus-docker

For now this is a bare bones working implimentation of STEGG that we can use for testing. Honestly, I hope to just release the docker image on docker hub and the webserver for people to use. If people look at my code too long, they may go blind.

To build the docker container, you must first the frequency matrices generated using MHCFlurry2.0 through the link below: https://rice.box.com/s/duxshqxtkykg7u9y3b0tl79j8byc2dp2 After the csv is downloaded, put it on the Ape-Gen2.0-main/helper_files folder.

You must also download korp6Dv1.bin https://chaconlab.org/modeling/korp/down-korp/item/korp-linux and place it in both the Ape-Gen2.0-main/RCD_required_files folder and the T-RECS/RCD_required_files folder.
